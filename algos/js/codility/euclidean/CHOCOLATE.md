# Chocolate by Numbers

## Problem

Two positive integers $N$ and $M$ are given. Integer $N$ represents the number of chocolates arranged in a circle, numbered from $0$ to $N − 1$.

You start to eat the chocolates. After eating a chocolate you leave only a wrapper.

You begin with eating chocolate number $0$. Then you omit the next $M − 1$ chocolates or wrappers on the circle, and eat the following one.

More precisely, if you ate chocolate number $X$, then you will next eat the chocolate with number $(X + M)$ modulo $N$ (remainder of division).

You stop eating when you encounter an empty wrapper.

For example, given integers $N = 10$ and $M = 4$. You will eat the following chocolates: 0, 4, 8, 2, 6.

The goal is to count the number of chocolates that you will eat, following the above rules.

Write a function:

```js
    function solution(N, M);
```

that, given two positive integers $N$ and $M$, returns the number of chocolates that you will eat.

For example, given integers $N = 10$ and $M = 4$. the function should return 5, as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

- $N$ and $M$ are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000].


## Solution

I admit that it took me some re-reading before I could grasp this problem. What made it easier to grasp was the example.

This solution can be found on Codility [here](https://app.codility.com/demo/results/trainingSXZ3KT-MV4/).

```js
function gcd(a, b) {
    if(a % b === 0) {
        return b;
    } else {
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}

function solution(N, M) {    
    if(N === 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    
    if(M === 1) {
        return N;
    }
    
    return N / gcd(N, M);
}
```

Look at that solution! So simple. If you had known _Number Theory_, this would have been a walk in the park. This is just based on mathematical principles.

If we take the case that is provided and use the formula within the solution, which is `N / gcd(N, M)`, then we can see the magic of this solution. Given that `gcd` is the greatest common divisor, we can determine that the _gcd_ of 10 and 4 is 2. When 10 is divided by 2, we get 5.

Let's try a different case. Let's try $N = 12$ and $M = 3$. Starting at 0, the chocolates that can be eaten following the rule of using $(X + 3)$ modulo $12$ are 0, 3, 6, 9. So, only 4 chocolates can be eaten following this rule for this case. Given that the _gcd_ of 12 and 3 is 3. When 12 is divided by 3, we get 4.

Now that we have proven this solution with another case, the question we are left with is: Why does _gcd_ work for finding the number of possibilities with the restriction of the arithmetic modulo rule?

The detected time complexity of this solution is $O(log(n + m))$. Since recursion is used, the detected space complexity is $O(n)$.
