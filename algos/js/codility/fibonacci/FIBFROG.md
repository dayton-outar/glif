# Fibonacci Frog

## Problem

The Fibonacci sequence is defined using the following recursive formula:

$F(0) = 0$

$F(1) = 1$

$F(M) = F(M - 1) + F(M - 2) \text{ if } M >= 2$

A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is initially located at one bank of the river (position − 1) and wants to get to the other bank (position, $N$). The frog can jump over any distance $F(K)$, where $F(K)$ is the $K$-th Fibonacci number. Luckily, there are many leaves on the river, and the frog can jump between the leaves, but only in the direction of the bank at position $N$.

The leaves on the river are represented in an array $A$ consisting of $N$ integers. Consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive positions from $0$ to $N − 1$ on the river. Array $A$ contains only 0s and/or 1s:

- 0 represents a position without a leaf;
- 1 represents a position containing a leaf.

The goal is to count the minimum number of jumps in which the frog can get to the other side of the river (from (position − 1) to position, $N$). The frog can jump between (positions − 1) and $N$ (the banks of the river) and every position containing a leaf.

For example, consider array A such that:

```js
    A[0] = 0
    A[1] = 0
    A[2] = 0
    A[3] = 1
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 0
    A[6] = 1
    A[7] = 0
    A[8] = 0
    A[9] = 0
    A[10] = 0
```

The frog can make three jumps of length $F(5) = 5$, $F(3) = 2$ and $F(5) = 5$.

Write a function:

```js
    function solution(A);
```

that, given an array $A$ consisting of $N$ integers, returns the minimum number of jumps by which the frog can get to the other side of the river. If the frog cannot reach the other side of the river, the function should return −1.

For example, given:
```js
    A[0] = 0
    A[1] = 0
    A[2] = 0
    A[3] = 1
    A[4] = 1
    A[5] = 0
    A[6] = 1
    A[7] = 0
    A[8] = 0
    A[9] = 0
    A[10] = 0
```

the function should return 3, as explained above.

Write an **efficient** algorithm for the following assumptions:

- $N$ is an integer within the range $[0 ... 100,000]$;
- each element of array $A$ is an integer that can have one of the following values: 0, 1.

## Solution

Basically, there are a set of steps from one point to the next that a frog has to make his way across but his jumps are in levels of the fibonacci numbers. _The frog can jump between (positions − 1) and N (the banks of the river) and every position containing a leaf_. The aim is to _find the minimum number of jumps it takes to get to the other bank of the river, N_. The frog is not allowed to jump to any position greater than $N$.

solution( [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] ); // 3
```

This solution makes use of a number of techniques to deliver accurate results at optimal performance. There is use of [Dynamic Programming](../dynamic/) and the main loop (the fourth one in the `solution` function) uses two pointers to maintain a hashtable that [count occurences](../counting/) of jumps.

Before the `solution` function transitions into the final loop, it prepares 3 arrays (or hashtable depending on how you see it) to better track the possible jumps that can be made into the appropriate positions possible. The first loop simply adds the _(position - 1)_ as a baseline to start from in the `arr` array, where 1 is placed at the beginning index, 0, of this array. The `arr` states the appropriate positions possible for the frog to land. The `fib` array keeps the possible jumps (distance that the frog can jump) limited by the distance between one bank of the river to the other bank, which is the length of the array plus 1. The illustration below justifies the formula from which $N$ is derived by using the case given the provided array, `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` from the example in the problem statement.

The `steps` array, is the array that will be updated to keep track of all _viable_ possibilities from each position and is critically important in _find the minimum number of jumps it takes to get to the other bank of the river, N_.

![Starting Position of Fibonacci Frog](/.attachments/fibonacci-frog-base-0.png)

As seen in the illustration above when the main loop starts to fill out the `steps` array, it starts from `base` equal to 0 and it iterates through all the possible fibonacci numbers to find _a step_ that lands on a _leaf_ (basically a position in `arr` where the value is 1). The distance from one bank to the next is 12, so when the iteration reaches the 7<sup>th</sup> number in the fibonacci sequence (13), the fibonacci iteration pointer, `i`, is reset and the `base` is incremented (because of the condition `nextPos > N`).

Since, `nextPos` is calculated based on the fibonacci numbers, some positions from the `base` will obviously be skipped out from the condition, `arr[nextPos] === 1`, such as 4, 6, 7 and so on that are not found in the fibonacci sequence. This is the reason that index 4 is skipped in the deduction from `arr` array, even though it's value is 1.

Now that the process flow of the final loop has been explained and illustrated with the provided use case. There is a calculation instruction and a logical structure within the main loop that must be highlighted.

The calculation instruction that must be highlighted is the assignments involving the use of `Math.min`. `Math.min` is used to always maintain track of the _minimum number of viable jumps_ between two positions, especially given that the technique of [count occurences](../counting/) is used. So, when the `steps` array is completed, every position must state the _minimum number of viable jumps_ it takes the frog to get to that position.

The logical structure that must be highlighted is the snippet of code shown below, which basically is resposible for delivering the result of all the computation within the `solution`,

```js
if(result < 0) {
    result = steps[base] + 1;
} else {
    result = Math.min(result, steps[base] + 1);
}
```

This logical structure is arrived at whenever `nextPos` is equal to `N`, where $N$ is position of the other bank of the river. Given that all possible jumps of the frog are being considered, it is possible that the loop will hit this condition multiple times (`nextPos === N`). There could be several possibilities to bring the frog to its destination (directly landing at $N$). So, `result` is created to keep track of the _minimum viable jumps_ possible to arrive at $N$. Given that `result` is initiated at `-1`, the condition, `result < 0` was installed to prevent `Math.min` from choosing the negative number. If the `result` is negative, it simply means that it has just arrived at a possibility of reaching $N$ throughout the previous iterations of the main loop (or the fourth loop).

So, to further describe the importance of the logical structure maintaining the `result` variable, we can use the use case provided. When the frog arrives at position 7 (which is index 7 in the `steps`) array, the _minimum viable jumps_ to get to that position is 2. When `nextPos` is calculated to be 12, it enters this logical structure for the first time with `result` equal to -1. The program flows to the instruction where the `result` is calculated by adding 1 to the _minimum viable jumps_ possible to 7 because the frog only needs one more jump from position 7 to reach position 12 (i.e. $N$) to account for the frog making a possible _minimum viable jumps_ from one bank of the river to the other. (I think no explanation is needed to explain the `else` part of this logical structure since hints have been given in a previous paragraph).

The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n \cdot \text{log }n)$. Understandably so, the first set of loops iterate through each element of the provided array. So, the three loops would give us a formula like $n + n + 1 + n + 2$ (or $3n + 3$). Since, the last loop is iterated based on calculations of the fibonacci sequence, we get a harmonic rythm from it and, hence, the reason for the loop to perform in $\text{log }n$ time.
