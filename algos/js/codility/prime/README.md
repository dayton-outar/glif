# 10. Prime and Composite Numbers

People have been analyzing prime numbers since time immemorial, but still we continue to search for fast new algorithms that can check the primality of numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has exactly two divisors (1 and itself). A composite number has more than two divisors.

> Every integer greater than 1 is either prime or composite, but not both.[^1]

In the above picture the primes are highlighted in white and composite numbers are shown in gray.

## 10.1. Counting Divisors

Let’s count the number of divisors of $n$. The easiest approach is to iterate through all the numbers from 1 to $n$ and check whether or not each one is a divisor. The time complexity of this solution is $O(n)$.

There is a simple way to improve the above solution. Based on one divisor, we can ﬁnd the symmetric divisor. More precisely, if number $a$ is a divisor of $n$, then $n \over a$ is also a divisor. One of these two divisors is less than or equal to $\sqrt n$. (If that were not the case, $n$ would be a product of two numbers greater than $\sqrt n$, which is impossible.)

Thus, iterating through all the numbers from 1 to $\sqrt n$ allows us to ﬁnd all the divisors. If number $n$ is of the form $k^2$, then the symmetric divisor of $k$ is also $k$. This divisor should be counted just once.

**10.1: Counting the number of divisors - $O(\sqrt n)$.**
```js
const divisors = n => {
    let i = 1;
    let result = 0;

    while ( i * i < n ) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            result += 2;
        }
        i++;
    }

    if ( i * i == n ) {
        result++;
    }

    return result;
}

divisors(8); // 4
```

## 10.2. Primality Test

The primality test of $n$ can be performed in an analogous way to counting the divisors. If we ﬁnd a number between 2 and $n − 1$ that divides $n$ then $n$ is a composite number. Otherwise, $n$ is a prime number.

**10.2: Primality test - $O(n)$.**
```js
const primality = n => {
    let i = 2;

    while ( i * i <= n ) {
        if ( n % i == 0 ) return false;
        i++;
    }

    return true;
}

primality(7); // true
primality(9); // false
```

We assume that 1 is neither a prime nor a composite number, so the above algorithm works only for $n \geq 2$.

## 10.3 Exercise

**Problem:** Consider $n$ coins aligned in a row. Each coin is showing heads at the beginning.

![Coins 1 to 10](/.attachments/coins.png)

Then, $n$ people turn over corresponding coins as follows. Person $i$ reverses coins with numbers that are multiples of $i$. That is, person i ﬂips coins $i, 2 · i, 3 · i, \ldots$ until no more appropriate coins remain. The goal is to count the number of coins showing tails. In the above example, the ﬁnal conﬁguration is:

![Coins 1, 4, 9 flipped](/.attachments/coins-1-4-9.png)

**Solution $O(n\text{ }log\text{ }n)$:** We can simulate the results of each person reversing coins.

**10.3: Reversing coins - $O(n\text{ }log\text{ }n)$.**
```js
const coins = n => {
    let result = 0;
    //  0 represents coins showing heads while 1 represents coins showing tails
    let coin = Array(n).fill(0); // We begin with all coins showing heads

    for ( let i = 1; i <= n;i++ ) {
        let k = i;
        while ( k <= n ) {
            coin[k - 1] = (coin[k - 1] + 1) % 2; // Shift k - 1 to accommodate array index
            k += i; // Increment by i. This fulfills requirement that person i can only flip coins that are multiple of i
        }
        result += coin[i - 1]; // Counting the 1s (the coins showing tails). Shift to accomodate array index based on starting at i = 1
    }

    return result;
}

coins(10); // 3 ... coin array = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
```

The number of operation can be estimated by ${n \over 1} + {n \over 2} + \ldots + {n \over n}$, what equals $n · ({1 \over 1} + {1 \over 2} + \ldots + {1 \over n})$. The sums of multiplicative inverses (reciprocals) of the ﬁrst $n$ numbers are called harmonic numbers, which asymptotically equal $O(log\text{ }n)$[^2]. In summary, the total time complexity is $O(n\text{ }log\text{ }n)$.

**Solution $O(n\text{ }log\text{ }n)$:** Notice that each coin will be turned over exactly as many times as the number of its divisors. The coins that are reversed an odd number of times show tails, meaning that it is suﬃcient to ﬁnd the coins with an odd number of divisors. 

We know that almost every number has a symmetric divisor (apart from divisors of the form $\sqrt n$). Thus, every number of the form $k^2$ has an odd number of divisors. There are exactly $\lfloor \sqrt n \rfloor$ such numbers between 1 and $n$. Finding the value of $\lfloor \sqrt n \rfloor$ takes logarithmic time (or constant time if we use operations on ﬂoating point numbers).

## Observations

The hardest thing to grasp is the problem in the Exercise because of it's brevity. The impression of the problem is that given we have 10 coins, there will be 10 persons to flip the coins. Each person is assigned a number, for the case of 10 persons flipping 10 coins, we start with person #1 only allowed to flip coins of multiples of 1. Person #2 is allowed to flip coins that are multiples of 2. So, the coins will go through a lot of flipping as we progress from person #1 to person #10.

The coins are showing heads at the very beginning of this exercise.

- The first person flips all coins since all numbers are a multiple of 1. So, all numbers are now showing tails.
- The second person flips 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 since they can only flip multiples of 2.

See below the outcome of each person flipping the coins below (0s means coins showing heads and 1s means coins showing tails),

```
1  ... 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
2  ... 1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0
3  ... 1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0
4  ... 1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0
5  ... 1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1
6  ... 1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1
7  ... 1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1
8  ... 1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1
9  ... 1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1
10 ... 1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
```
