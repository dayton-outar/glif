# 8.5 Spanning Trees

Consider the graph representing the airline connections between seven cities ­(Figure 8.14a). If the economic situation forces this airline to shut down as many connections as possible, which of them should be retained to make sure that it is still possible to reach any city from any other city, if only indirectly? One possibility is the graph in ­Figure 8.14b.
