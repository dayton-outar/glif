# Algorithm Lessons in C++

Most of the lessons and source code found in this folder were sourced from,

 1. Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, Fourth Edition by Adam Drozdek
 2. [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
 3. [FavTutor](https://favtutor.com/)

There is mention of [Compiler Design](./compiler-design/) in this folder. Most of the theory was inspired by,

 1. Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools by Alfred Aho (1986)
 2. Compiler Design in C by Allen I. Holub (1990)

Observations were added to supplement the lessons and source code of the algorithms except compiler design. More in-depth explanation is offered in the books mentioned for compiler design.
