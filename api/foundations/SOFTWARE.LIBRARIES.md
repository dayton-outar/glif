# Creating and Using Software Libraries

## 1 Introduction

These notes summarize how to create and use static and shared libraries in a UNIX environment. They are designed to be tutorial and elementary. For a more advanced explanation about creating and using library files, I strongly recommend that you read David Wheeler's [Program Library HOWTO](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/index.html).

These notes begin by explaining a bit about software libraries in general, then proceed to describe the differences between static and shared libraries. After this conceptual material, they describe the how-to's about creating and using both types of libraries using the tools available in a GNU-based UNIX system such as Linux. The discussion here is limited to executables and libraries in the _Executable and Link Format_ (ELF), which is the format used by Linux and most UNIX systems at the time of this writing. If you do not know what this means or why it might be important, that is fine; you may safely ignore this.

If you think you do not need the conceptual discussions, you can just "cut to the chase" and jump directly to the appropriate section below, either [5](#5-creating-a-static-library) and [6](#6-using-a-static-library) for static libraries or [7]() and [8]() for shared libraries.
